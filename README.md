# GPT Conversation Analysis

A tool for analyzing ChatGPT conversations against my `AI Decision Loop for GenAI` and generating heatmaps to visualize interaction patterns. This tool helps you understand your AI usage patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of your conversations.

## AI Decision Loop
ðŸš€The 5 Steps (Each with Adaptive Loops)
 1. Frame the Decision Context & Guide AI Prompting
 2. Generate Multi-Perspective AI Outputs & Validate Responses
 3. Apply Human Judgment & Adjust AI Interaction
 4. Test for Bias & Feasibility
 5. Refine, Iterate, and Automate Where Possible
 * Adaptive Loops: At any step, return to prior steps as needed to fine-tune prompts, recheck assumptions, or mitigate new biases.

## Features

### Conversation Analysis

- Analyzes chat conversations using OpenAI's GPT-4
- Evaluates decision-making processes and interaction patterns
- Generates detailed markdown reports for each conversation

### Heatmap Generation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/000772ed-7754-4ee3-84b7-0a2cd5f3aaa3)

- Creates visual heatmaps showing:
  - Conversation frequency by day and hour
  - Usage patterns over time
  - Interaction hotspots

### Analysis Output
- Markdown reports for each conversation including:
  - Interaction analysis
  - Decision-making evaluation
  - Pattern identification
  - Recommendations for improvement

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key
- ChatGPT conversation exports (JSON format)
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Exporting ChatGPT Conversations

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click on your profile picture in the bottom-left corner
3. Select 'Settings'
4. Click on 'Data controls'
5. Under 'Export data', click 'Export'
6. Wait for the export to be prepared (you'll receive an email)
7. Download the export file (it will be a .zip)
8. Extract the conversations.json file from the zip
9. Copy the JSON file to your project's `chats` directory

Note: The export will contain all your ChatGPT conversations. You can either analyze all of them or select specific conversations by copying only those you want to analyze into the `chats` directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt-heatmap.git
   cd gpt-heatmap
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. Prepare your data:
   - Create a `chats` directory in the project root
   - Place your ChatGPT conversation JSON files in the `chats` directory

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run chat analysis
python app.py

# Run analysis with custom output directory
python app.py -o custom_output_dir

# Generate heatmap visualizations
python app.py --heatmap

# Generate PDFs from analysis (3 files)
python app.py --pdf 3

# Generate PDFs with custom size limit (10MB per file)
python app.py --pdf 3 --pdf-size-limit 10
```

### PDF Generation

The tool can merge analysis markdown files into PDF documents for easier sharing and reading:

- `--pdf N`: Generate approximately N PDF files (may create more to respect size limits)
- `--pdf-dir DIR`: Save PDFs to specified directory (default: pdf_analysis)
- `--pdf-size-limit MB`: Maximum size per PDF in megabytes (default: 10MB)

The PDF generation process:
1. Converts each markdown file to PDF
2. Sorts PDFs by size (largest first)
3. Merges PDFs while respecting size limits
4. Reports size of each generated file

Requirements:
- Node.js and npm (for mdpdf)
- Install mdpdf globally: `npm install -g mdpdf`

### Configuration

You can customize the analysis by modifying the `Config` class in `configuration.py`:
- `CONVO_FOLDER`: Location of conversation files
- `RESEARCH_FOLDER`: Default output directory
- `DEFAULT_MODEL`: GPT model to use (default: 'gpt-4')
- `DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE`: Model temperature (default: 0.62)
- `MAX_WORKERS`: Number of parallel analysis threads

## Output Structure

```
output_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_id1.md
â”œâ”€â”€ conversation_id2.md
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each markdown file contains:

1. Brief Summary
   - Overview of objectives and approach

2. Five-Step Decision Loop Analysis
   - Problem Framing & Initial Prompting
   - Response Evaluation & Validation
   - Expertise Application
   - Critical Assessment
   - Process Improvement
   - Overall Assessment

3. Collaborative Pattern Analysis
   - Observed Patterns
   - Novel Patterns

4. Recommendations
   - Improvement suggestions
   - Action steps
   - Strategic adjustments
